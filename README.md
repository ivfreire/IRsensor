Clouds have a significant effect on the local weather. Acting not only as a cover to the surface deflecting sunlight back to space, but also absorbing and reflecting infrared radiation to the ground.

In order to understand the role of clouds in the radioactive tranfers occuring in the atmosphere, we must have an effective way of measuring the temperature of their bases. Unfortunately, remote sensing equipment can not be used for this purpuse since the bottom of clouds is not visible from space. Currently, high-cost delicate in-site infrared sensors are being used to measure their temperature.

In this project, a low-cost infrared sensor is mounted to an Arduino board to collect temperature data from the clouds in the city of São Paulo. We will then compare the measurements taken by the Arduino set to the ones taken by a high-end infrared termometer available in the CIENTEC park.

## Getting started

All the Arduino C code is available here. In order to run you must install the correct addons for the ESP32 camera and for the Adafruit DHT shield, which logs the temperature to a SD card for later analysis.
