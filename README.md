Clouds have a significant effect on the local weather. Acting not only as a cover to the surface deflecting sunlight back to space, but also absorbing and reflecting infrared radiation to the ground.

In order to understand the role of clouds in the radioactive tranfers occuring in the atmosphere, we must have a effective way of measuring the temperature of their bases. Unfortunately, remote sensing equipment can not be used for this purpuse since the bottom of clouds is not visible from space. Currently, high-cost fragile in-site infrared sensors are being used to measure their temperature.

In this project, an low-cost infrared sensor is mounted to an Arduino board to collect data from clouds in the city of São Paulo. We will then compare the measurements taken with the Arduino set to the ones taken by the high-end infrared termometer available in-site.

## Getting started

All the code developed for the weather station is available in here.
